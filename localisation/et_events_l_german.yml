 et.EVTNAME4:0 "Das Große Schisma"
 et.EVTDESC4:0 "Die Kirchen im Osten und Westen haben sich schon für eine lange Zeit in verschiedene Richtungen weiterentwickelt, aber die jüngsten Meinungsverschiedenheiten zwischen den Patriarchen von Rom und Konstantinopel haben diese Probleme an die Oberfläche gebracht. Für die gesamte Christenheit ist die Zeit gekommen, ihre Seite zu wählen!"

 et.EVTOPTA9:0 "Großartig!"
 et.EVTNAME10:0 "Das Große Schisma wurde beendet"
 et.EVTDESC10:0 "Endlich ist der große Schisma zwischen der westlichen katholischen Kirche und der östlichen orthodoxen Kirche beendet worden. Mit der Wiedervereinigung der Pentarchie, einschließlich des wichtigen Bischofssitzes von Rom, hält der katholische Glaube nun nur noch wenig Macht über die Menschen in Europa. Es gibt welche, die noch an ihm festhalten aber sie sind von geringer Anzahl, und die Pentarchie kann ihre Herrschaft über die ganze Christenheit noch einmal behaupten."

 et.EVTOPTA15:0 "Großartig!"
 et.EVTNAME16:0 "Saint Patrick"
 et.EVTDESC16:0 "They call him Patrick. For some time now, he has wandered our lands, spreading the word of christianity among our people. His zeal is without parallel; he has endured countless imprisonments at the hands of local leaders, beatings by brigands, and more in the name of his god. And yet still he proselytises, and his fame grows, along with the number of people who believe his words."
 et.EVTOPTA16:0 "Curse this spreader of falsehoods!"
 et.EVYOPTB16:0 "Perhaps he has been so successful because he speaks the truth..."
 et.EVTNAME18:0 "Die Teilung Roms"
 et.EVTDESC18:0 "Wir haben uns dazu entschlossen, das römische Imperium entzwei zu teilen. Nun müssen wir entscheiden, ob wir den westlichen Teil von Rom aus, oder den östlichen Teil von Kostantinopel aus regieren wollen."

 et.EVTNAME20:0 "Geburt der Religion Shinto"
 et.EVTDESC20:0 "Eine neue Religion namens Shinto ist geboren und hat sich unter den Menschen von $PROVINCENAME$ verbreitet.

 et.EVTOPTA20:0 "Interessant."
 et.EVTNAME21:0 "Ausbreitung des Shinto"

 et.EVTNAME26:0 "Untergang des Reiches"
 et.EVTDESC26:0 "Die kontinuierlichen Revolten und die allgemeine Instabilität machen es uns schwierig, das Imperium zu verwalten. Wir müssen unsere Stabilitätsbemühen verstärken, bevor unser Imperium zugrunde geht."
 et.EVTOPTA26:0 "Es sieht nicht gut aus."
 et.EVTNAME27:0 "Mord am Kaiser"
 et.EVTDESC27:0 "Der Kaiser wurde von seiner eigenen prätorianischen Garde ermordet. Die Garde behauptet, dass der Kaiser von seiner Macht geblendet wurde und das Reich ins Verderben stürzen wollte. Die Prätorianer haben einen neuen Kaiser installiert und haben den Senat gezwungen, seinen Anspruch zu akzeptieren. Allerdings gibt es noch viele, die dem neuen Kaiser das Recht verweigern, das Imperium zu regieren."
 et.EVTOPTA27:0 "Das ist gar nicht gut."

 et.EVTDESC34:0 "The theological dogma of dyophysitism - the Christological position that two natures, divine and human, exist in the person of Jesus Christ - has sparked a heated theological debate in the Churches of the Caucasus. After a Council held between the various Churches of the Caucasus in $PROVINCENAME$, the Armenian Church has officially condemned the dogma of dyophysitism. Based on its understanding of the writings of Cyril of Alexandria, the Church of Armenia now professes the Miaphysite doctrine. Miaphysitism is the formula holding that in the person of Jesus Christ, divine nature and human nature are united (mia – 'one' or 'unity') without separation, without mixture, without confusion and without alteration, in one single compound nature ('physis')."

 et.EVTNAME55:0 "Boudica's Uprising"
 et.EVTDESC55:0 "The tribe of the Iceni and their king Prasutagus used to be our allies. Prasutagus even favored us so much that he named the Roman Emperor his co-heir along with his two daughters. However, after Prasutagus died, we took total control over the Iceni and deprived the local nobles and Prasutagus' daughters of their lands. This left the local population outraged and now Prasutagus' wife, Boudica has rallied the Iceni tribe into to a rebellion against the Empire."

 et.EVTNAME64:0 "The Birth of Ibadi Islam"
 et.EVTDESC64:0 "20 years after the death of Muhammad, Jabir ibn Zayd of Nizwa, Oman began the Ibadi movement, developing it in Basra. The Ibadis were opposed to the rule of the third and fourth Rashidun Caliph, Uthman and Ali, but unlike extremist groups, tolerated other religious viewpoints. Ibadi Islam eventually developed in Oman where the Imam was elected unlike in Shia and Sunni Islam in which the title was hereditary.

Again, the Ibadis were defeated retreating to Shibam. The Umayyad Caliphate the was forced to retreat because of rebellions in Damascus and signed a treaty with the Ibadi leaders. Shibam would become a sanctioned Ibadi community so long as they pay taxes to the Caliphate. For the next four centuries, the Ibadi religion was based in Shibam."

 et.EVTNAME67:0 "Ibadi in M'zab"
 et.EVTDESC67:0 "The Ibadi faith originally entered Berber lands through the Rustamid dynasty who ruled from their capital in Tiaret.
