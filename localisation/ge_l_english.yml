These rumors are damaging enough to our reputation, but the situation has gotten worse now that a child has been born with questionable origins. Although it is not certain that he is a bastard child, the rumors of our consort has already convinced many that it is so... and, unfortunately, some evidence does indeed line up in support of this rumor.

 desc_provacateur_personality:0 "This ruler is a Provocateur. Talented in the art of stirring trouble and delighting in incensing even the most level-headed of foreign rulers and diplomats, their sharp tongue ensures that this mischief is not wasted, as it makes insults very effective in boosting our power projection."

 desc_prodigy_personality:0 "This ruler is a Prodigy. Showing extraordinary talent in multiple different fields and great promise from a young age, our state and country are sure to prosper under their rule."
 
 desc_impaler_personality:0 "This ruler is an Impaler. Taking twisted pleasure in the impalement of both enemies and allies alike, this ruler is one who razes as a pastime. The threat of impalement certainly keeps rebels in check, but it also alienates foreign powers, making diplomacy quite difficult... especially when our ruler can't resist impaling their embassadors."
 desc_extravagant_personality:0 "This ruler is Extravagant. Wasteful in spending, an Extravagant ruler builds only the most sumptuous of castles and wears the most expensive garb in the land... even when in debt. However, the habit of showering lavish gifts on foreign rulers and throwing expensive parties for noblemen makes him very likeable among the ruling class."
 desc_easygoing_personality:0 "This ruler is Easygoing. Lax in domestic and military affairs, our armies will lack discipline, and local officials will have greater autonomy. At the same time, a hands-off approach means that our people are more content and less likely to rebel."
 desc_puritan_personality:0 "This ruler is Puritan. Morally strict and simple in living, our ruler believes in the purification of the true faith and the Church. Disregarding the more primitive heathens, our ruler instead takes greater issue with Heretics, those deemed to be making the true faith impure."
 desc_seducer_personality:0 "This ruler is a Seductor. Skilled in appealing to others' emotional needs and desires, he is very effective in gathering information from foreign families in the private, although this negatively affects us in the eyes of the church. (Because this ruler is male, the chances of seducing and hiring women of talent is much higher)"
 desc_seductress_personality:0 "This ruler is a Seductress. Skilled in appealing to others' emotional needs and desires, she is very effective in gathering information from foreign families in the private, although this negatively affects us in the eyes of the church."
 desc_proud_personality:0 "This ruler is Proud. Holding themselves in great importance, perhaps much more so than they should, a Proud ruler earns him or herself the disdain of all foreign rulers and diplomats alike. However, such a high image of oneself does have some benefits, as someone so vain may win over the people with exaggerated achievements and gigantic monuments."
 desc_cynical_personality:0 "This ruler is Cynical. A skeptic of all things, ranging from shady diplomats to their own true faith, our ruler is the opposite of a spiritual ruler. However, such a cynical view of the world is also quite helpful in catching acts of foreign espionage."
 desc_trusting_personality:0 "This ruler is Trusting. While this leaves our nation vulnerable to foreign espionage, our ruler's trusting nature also means more relaxed relations with foreign diplomats, making establishing friendly relations easier with arriving diplomats and, thus, their sovereigns."
 desc_hotheaded_personality:0 "This ruler is Hotheaded. Always taking up arms at every little perceived offense, this ruler is too stubborn to back down or surrender even in the face of defeat. This trait, while helpful in inspiring our soldiers during wartime, takes quite the hit on our reputation during times of peace."
 desc_reckless_leader_personality:0 "This ruler is a Reckless Leader. Ordering his men to charge headlong in battle, and sometimes even leading the vanguard themself, this ruler often quickly depletes our resources through their continual reckless and aggressive campaigns into enemy lands."
 desc_unorthodox_personality:0 "This ruler is Unorthodox. Habitually going against the orthodox doctrine, this ruler often sympathizes with heretics, sometimes unintentionally. Although claiming to follow the true faith, their actions speak louder than their words... and their actions are saying that this ruler is a heretic."
 desc_ethnocentric_personality:0 "This ruler is Ethnocentric. While not outright xenophobic, this ruler will promote their own culture and peoples above all else, often times at the expense of other cultural minorities. Such a ruler will attempt to shape others in the mold of their own culture and aim to conquer lands inhabited by cultures aligning with their own." 
 desc_pyromaniac_personality:0 "This ruler is a Pyromaniac. Taking strange delight in watching things burn, whether they be buildings, farms, or people, this ruler's fiery method of warfare makes conquered peoples much more difficult to pacify after burning down their homes. Fortunately, however, our ruler is sure to secure the gold before setting fire to our enemies' treasury."
 desc_ruthless_personality:0 "This ruler is Ruthless. Believing wholeheartedly that the ends justify the means, this ruler will do whatever it takes to achieve their goal. Unfortunately, this quality is well known to all foreign rulers, many of whom keep an eye on our ruler for any signs of aggression."
 desc_two_faced_personality:0 "This ruler is Two-Faced. Excelling at acting kind, albeit insincerely, to diplomats and foreign families, in truth this ruler is a tyrant at the home. Foreign powers may see this ruler as a kind and trustworthy individual, but their own people know exactly what kind of ruler they are beneath the facade."
 desc_overly_generous_personality:0 "This ruler is Overly Generous. While their great magnamity keeps all of their subjects happy and loyal to the state, their habits of taking these funds directly from the treasury often empties our coffers much faster than their statesmen would prefer."
 
 desc_paranoid_personality:0 "This ruler is Paranoid. Sleeping with one eye open, this may catch more cases of treachery, but such a ruler is also more likely of suspecting the innocent and employing less talented advisors. Thus, overestimating the enemy, being wary of diplomatic offers, and preemptive betrayal of otherwise innocent allies are all common among paranoid rulers."
 desc_immature_personality:0 "This ruler is Immature. Childish and impulsive, our ruler acts crudely at inappropriate times; as a result, none take us seriously. But this is a double-edged sword, however, as they are less likely to acknowledge our expansions a legitimate threat, perhaps out of embarrasment of feeling threatened by a man-child of a ruler." 
 desc_lustful_personality:0 "This ruler is Lustful. Preoccupied only by sexual desire, this ruler is eager to engage in numerous royal marriages without care for political consequences. Having poor reputation among the Church as a result, a Lustful ruler is also more likely to be deceived through seduction by foreign spies."
 desc_unfaithful_personality:0 "This ruler is Unfaithful. Often breaking promises, including marriage vows, our ruler has built up a poor reputation from betrayal in both the realms of diplomacy and the bedroom. An unfaithful ruler is surrounded by an heavy aura of bad karma, and thus other nations are more likely to view us with caution."
 desc_overbearing_personality:0 "This ruler is Overbearing. Habitually speaking with a condescending tone, whether purposefully or not, our ruler is likely to offend our subjects by asserting too much authority over them. Our ruler is also less likely to accept offers of alliances from those deemed as lesser powers."
 desc_indecisive_personality:0 "This ruler is Indecisive. Struggling to reach a decision, our ruler may issue confusing or contradicting orders, slowing down the speed at which our armies mobilize. An indecisive ruler is also more likely to miss golden opportunities and abstain from taking action, or may declare wars coupled with poor timing."
 desc_sadistic_personality:0 "This ruler is Sadistic. Taking pleasure in watching others suffer, they are much more likely to raze and loot provinces. They also enjoy abusing their subjects and publicly executing traitors of the court in gruesome ways, which lowers subject opinion. At the same time, it may make those of our homeland think twice before rebelling."
 desc_barbaric_personality:0 "This ruler is Barbaric. The opposite of a civilized man of the court, our ruler's crude actions have earned him the mockery of foreign courts throughout the land. At the same time, our ruler's rowdiness has attracted the company of rough mercenaries, often drinking together late into the night and returning to the court hungover."
 desc_inferiority_complex_personality:0 "This ruler has an Inferiority Complex. Always perceiving others as greater in military and culture, our ruler will go to unnecessary ends to build the grandest, costliest ships and architecture to prove their worth. Such a ruler will also drag out wars in order to claim shallow 'merits' in battle."
 desc_xenophobic_personality:0 "This ruler is Xenophobic. Extremely intolerant towards other cultures, it will be exponentially more difficult to accept any culture other than our own. This ruler is also more likely to employ only those of the same culture and nationality within their inner circle."
 desc_dull_personality:0 "This ruler is Stupid. Taking little interest in... anything, our ruler is less likely to pick up on new ideas or pay attention to the politics of our own court, let alone global politics. Unfortunately for their consort, this insipidness also applies to the private chambers..."
 desc_treacherous_personality:0 "This ruler is Treacherous. Having no qualms in betraying anyone, even those of the same kin, this ruler will break alliances without hesitation. Although this activity gives us a terrible reputation, it makes it much easier for us to fabricate claims, especially with typical, standard morality being out of the question."
 desc_timid_personality:0 "This ruler is Timid. Although not necessarily a poor ruler or leader, this ruler will be intimidated by disgruntled citizens, and if tensions rise to the point that rebellion breaks out, this ruler will be unable to handle the pressure and find greater difficulty in suppressing the revolt. This ruler is also more likely to accept offers of peace from their enemies during war."
 desc_kinslayer_personality:0 "This ruler is a Kinslayer. Paranoid about the legitimacy of their heir and dominion, a Kinslayer will undergo all means to ensure a safe succession for their heir, whether through killing rival family members, or by accepting royal marriages to ensure a legitimate heir. For someone who has no qualms with killing kin, killing their own rebelling subjects should not be a problem either."
 desc_content_personality:0 "This ruler is Content. Competely satisfied with the comforts of the capital, this ruler has little to no ambition of expanding the nation beyond its current borders. Such a ruler is much less likely to declare war and, when war is actually necessary, is often unenthusiastic in making the proper preparations of war, such as producing official documents and conducting espionage."
 desc_delusional_personality:0 "This ruler is Delusional. Believing themself to be completely immune to danger, our ruler underestimates the odds of war and is thus more likely to openly declare war with powerful nations. Pushing our armies to unrealistic standards and exhausting our nation's resources, other nations are also less likely to aid us in our ruler's reckless military pursuits."
 desc_envious_personality:0 "This ruler is Envious. Always coveting the material wealth and prestige of other nations and their ruling class, a nation under this ruler is much harder to establish mutual diplomatic relations with; once an alliance is established, however, this ruler is reluctant to help their allies in any way, and may even betray their allies outright if he feels humiliated by their superior wealth."
 desc_slothful_personality:0 "This ruler is Slothful. This ruler would rather turn over in his bed and go back to sleep, delaying the dispatch of envoys on important diplomatic matters as well as the construction of key projects. This ruler also prefers to gain land through coercion rather than launch a preemptive strike themselves."
 desc_ignorant_personality:0 "This ruler is Ignorant. Completely disregarding warnings, customs and knowledge in general, often times willfully, this ruler has a particular talent in offending most people they interact with, and a particular lack of talent when it comes to grasping new ideas and innovations."
 desc_unprincipled_ruffian_personality:0 "This ruler is an Unprincipled Ruffian. Employing street thugs who answer only to their command, their methods are effective in suppressing feelings of revolt, though only temporarily, as their street gangs are undisciplined and violent enough to start riots on their own."
 desc_senile_personality:0 "This ruler is Senile. Unfortunately, this ruler's old age has taken a toll on their ability. This makes diplomacy increasingly difficult, as other nations are much less willing to aid a ruler who cannot even handle the affairs of their own state without their officials shouldering all of the work."
