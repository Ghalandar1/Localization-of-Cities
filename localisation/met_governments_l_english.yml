 habsburg_monarchy_desc:0 "Ruled by the Habsburg dynasty of Austria, the monarchy is divided into Hereditary Lands as well as lands acquired through personal union.

 great_yuan_empire:0 "Great Yuan State"
 great_yuan_empire_desc:0 "The Yuan dynasty established a unique form of the Chinese Celestial Empire that integrated many of the traditional and established Chinese institutions while maintaining distinct Mongolian policies and ruling class.

 expand_semu_classifications_reform_desc:0 "The Semuren class is the second highest caste of the Yuan empire and is made up of the peoples from Central and West Asia first conquered by the Mongol empire. Although they are ranked above the Hanren and Nanren, the lowest castes consisting of the Yuan's subsequently-conquered Chinese subjects, the Semuren are not a single identity but instead many different peoples administratively classified as Semu. Thus, the caste can be expanded by definition in order to grant greater privileges to more groups and cultures. However, such a move towards acceptance will also decrease the efficiency at which foreign subjects can be assimilated into the Mongol culture."
 sel_expand_vizier_powers_reform:0 "Expand Vizier Powers"

 sel_the_iqta_system_reform:0 "The Iqta System"

 carolingian_feudalism_reform_desc:0 "Through the efforts of Carolingian reforms that formalized and consolidated the power of the Frankish aristocracy, early feudalism has developed in Francia, in which comital vassals are granted the right to pass on their land and authority to their heirs in return for their loyalty to the crown, and for their military service in distant lands far from their own homes."
 missi_dominici_reform:0 "Missi Dominici"
 missi_dominici_reform_desc:0 "As with the case with other kingdoms of Western Europe, our state has an itinerant court, meaning that it does not have any single, stationary capital. Instead, our court travels throughout our lands to ensure that good governance is upheld in all counties of the kingdom. Still, we cannot be everywhere at once. Thus, we may appoint missi dominici to travel to distant counties in the kingdom in pairs, one ecclesiastical and one secular, and ensure the comites’ loyalty to our crown."
 scabini_reform:0 "Scabini"
 scabini_reform_desc:0 "Each count of the kingdom is granted seven scabini, professional experts on law who were expected to know every law so that all men could be judged according to them.

 edict_of_nantes_reform_desc:0 "An edict that grants substantial rights to the minority Huguenot population within France.

 nobility_in_versailles_reform:0 "Nobility in Versailles"
 nobility_in_versailles_reform_desc:0 "By inviting all of the French nobles to the royal court in Versailles, the power of the monarch is increased greatly at the expense of the nobility.
