 bkj_eastern_expansion_mission_title:1 "Eastern Expansion"
 bkj_eastern_expansion_mission_desc:0 "There was a time when the south was divided between the Samhan, but times have changed; while we have united the west, the eastern kingdoms grow stronger, even threatening our naval superiority over peninsula. Therefore, we must crush them at once, and unify the former Samhan once and for all!"
 bkj_liberate_the_north_mission_title:1 "Liberate the North"
 bkj_liberate_the_north_mission_desc:0 "There are former members of the Mahan Confederacy that are under the rule of our northern neighbors. Let us use the pretense of liberating our brethren to seize the lands of the north and dominate western Korea."

 bkj_great_eight_families_mission_desc:0 "The most powerful of the nobility, the Great Eight Families, hold great influence in our kingdom, both inside and outside of the royal court. Thus, it would be wise to appease the eight families and ensure they will not betray us in times of weakness."
 bkj_jwapyeong_mission_title:1 "Jwapyeong"

 #ASU Asturias
 asu_desierto_del_duero_mission_title:1 "Desierto del Duero"
 asu_desierto_del_duero_mission_desc:0 "Our success against the Moors can be attributed to our advantageous defensive position in the mountains of the Cantabrian Mountains. However, if we wish to survive as a kingdom, we must establish a buffer zone by taking lands north of the Duero River, and thus provide for the defense of our descendants for centuries to come." 
 asu_cross_the_duero_mission_title:1 "Cross the Duero"
 asu_cross_the_duero_mission_desc:0 "Our armies are strong and determined to retake the lands of Hispania for us Cristianos. Perhaps the time of reconquest has arrived. Thus, our first move must be to strike first against the Moors and take the lands south of the Duero River."
 asu_liberate_toledo_mission_title:1 "Liberate Toledo"

 asu_santiago_de_compostela_mission_desc:0 "We had found the remains of the apostle Saint James the Greater and constructed a shrine to him in Galicia, which is arguably the holiest site in all of Hispania.

 asu_visigothic_legacy_mission_title:1 "Visigothic Legacy"
 asu_visigothic_legacy_mission_desc:0 "Before the Moors came to rule over Hispania, the Christian Visigoths ruled this land. Now, the Christian realm has been limited to our kingdom's borders, and many of Visigoth and Suebi descent live in our lands. The Visigoths treated all its citizens equally, and their code provided equal punishments for Goths and Hispanians alike. Thus, we must adopt their policy of cultural acceptance and assimilate them as one Astur peoples."

 xib_usurp_the_xiongnu_mission_desc:0 "The Xiongnu were once a mighty confederation, but now they have fallen under the influence of the Chinese to the south and can do little but become subservient to their empire. Thus, the time for a new dominant confederation of the steppes has arrived, and we shall be the ones to fill that role."
 xib_subjugate_the_chanyu_mission_title:1 "Subjugate the Chanyu"
 xib_subjugate_the_chanyu_mission_desc:0 "The Chanyu of the Xiongnu is all but subject to our expanding confederation. It is imperative that we unite our forces and unify in the face of the Chinese imperial threat; only under a single banner can we hope to maintain independence, and possibly even supremacy, over the Celestial Empire."
 xib_the_drive_west_mission_title:1 "The Drive West"
 xib_the_drive_west_mission_desc:0 "With the powerful Chinese empire to the south, we must expand our power by driving farther west into the lands of Ferghana, for we cannot challenge the Celestial Empire with a guarantee of victory with the current size and manpower of our confederacy at its current state. Thus, let us tear across the foreign lands of the West!"
 xib_conquer_buyeo_mission_title:1 "Conquer Buyeo"
 xib_conquer_buyeo_mission_desc:0 "Most of our Xianbei peoples have never even seen the ocean in their lifetimes, as the steppes are all we have known.

 xib_annex_the_wuhuan_mission_title:1 "Annex the Wuhuan"
 xib_annex_the_wuhuan_mission_desc:0 "The Wuhuan tribes have long been subservient to the Chinese empire since the Han empire integrated them into their state and military. Let us liberate them from their Han oppressors and welcome them into the confederacy as equal members of a new empire of the steppes."
 xib_unite_the_five_hu_mission_title:1 "Unite the Five Hu"
 xib_unite_the_five_hu_mission_desc:0 "The Five Barbarians, divided, are at the mercy of Chinese imperial influence. However, should the Five Barbarians be united, we would be able to stand strong against Chinese influence and deny their demands of tribute so we may prosper. Let us thus integrate the Qiang peoples into our confederation as we have the Wuhuan."
 xib_defy_the_heavens_mission_title:1 "Defy the Heavens"
 xib_defy_the_heavens_mission_desc:0 "The Celestial Emperor claims to hold the Mandate of Heaven, even being so pretentious as to call himself the Son of Heaven. If this is truly the case, then let us defy the Heavens and prove to the world that no such mandate is in their hands!"
 xib_northern_wei_mission_title:1 "Northern Wei"
 xib_northern_wei_mission_desc:0 "Although we Xianbei in culture, the Middle Country is sure to fall into chaos from a power vacuum should a proper Celestial Emperor not exist. Thus, it would be wise for us to use this opportunity to claim the Mandate of Heaven ourselves so we may earn the loyalty of all of the Chinese peoples."
 xib_administer_the_lands_mission_title:1 "Administer the Lands"
 xib_administer_the_lands_mission_desc:0 "Our nomadic traditions make it difficult to maintain a permanent, unified Xianbei state. Let us expand our administration and adopt sedentary practices of the Chinese empire so we may maintain a stable, more centralized state of the Xianbei people."

 xib_the_khanate_system_mission_desc:0 "In order to establish a proper khanate, we must win the complete loyalty of the various tribes, Xianbei and otherwise, under our regime. Only then can we truly call ourselves the Khan of the steppes."

 avi_papal_protection_mission_title:0 "Papal Protection"
 avi_papal_protection_mission_desc:0 "Although our claim to the Papacy is legitimate, there are many supporters of the state in Roma that oppose us. In order to protect ourselves from our enemies, we must establish a strong network of powerful allies while still maintaining autonomy; in order to do so, it seems that establishing relations with the French crown is the most important nation to befriend."
 avi_imperial_relations_mission_title:0 "Imperial Relations"
 avi_imperial_relations_mission_desc:0 "Since the days of Charlemagne, the Holy Roman Emperor and the Papacy have been inextricably linked. Thus, if we estabish strong ties with the Emperor, or at least stronger than those of Rome, our diplomatic legitimacy will benefit greatly from such a move."
 avi_acquire_provence_mission_title:0 "Acquire Provence"
 avi_acquire_provence_mission_desc:0 "As it stands, our only path of expanding the lands of the Church is through the Provence. Furthermore, the ruler of Provence refuses to recognize our legitimate claim to the Papacy; this is more than enough of a pretense to seize the lands of Provence for the Avignon Church."

 avi_defeat_the_otto_sancti_mission_desc:0 "The Eight Saints of Italy threaten our autonomy as well as our claim to the Papacy. Thus, before we challenge Rome, we must assemble the strongest of allies and defeat the Eight Saints on the field, or subjugate them through diplomacy."

 pap_defeat_otto_sancti_mission_desc:0 "The city states of northern Italy threaten the sovereignty of the Church; while they formally answer our requests and are subject to us de jure, in practice they do not heed our demands and continue their threatening expansionist policy. Therefore, we must muster the allies of Christendom to assert our authority beyond Roma."
 pap_expand_church_lands_mission_title:0 "Expand Church Lands"
 pap_expand_church_lands_mission_desc:0 "In the past, land granted to the church was still effectively under the temporal rule of foreign powers, and often times these powers will act independently of, and sometimes even against, our interests despite their lands being nominally under the Church. Thus, let us seize land for the Church, whether diplomatically or by force, to ensure both temporal and religious rule over Italia and beyond."
