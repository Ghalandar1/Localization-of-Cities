While the Emperor acts more as a symbolic figure with little actual power, we can acquire titles to boost our legitimacy and prestige through diplomacy with the Imperial Court, and by granting fiefs to various noblemen and bureaucratic officials of the court, whose ancestors had longed served the Emperor, we can ensure that the imperial court is on our side. A shogun may also attain the highest noble title of kampaku, the regent of the Emperor, if the court's loyalty to the shogun is high enough."

 estate_commanderies_desc:0 "The Commanderies are a system of generals that maintain the Imperial army. Eager to prove their valor and advance in rank, they will be satisfied through waging war and granting titles as well as castles to their commanders.
