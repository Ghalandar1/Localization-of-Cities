 use_nuke_desc:0 "By using nuclear weapons we can cause great devastation to a single enemy province as well as increase their war exhaustion making them more willing to accept peace. However, it will also make them much more willing to use their nukes on us, if they have any, so we should be careful when trying to nuke another nuclear power.\n\nThis action will not lunch the nuke straight away, but you will get to choose the target province first."
