 et_institutions.17.t:0 "Early Feudalism"
 et_institutions.17.d:0 "The classic version of feudalism describes a set of obligations among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of lords, vassals and fiefs. A lord is in broad terms a noble who holds land, a vassal is a person who is granted possession of the land by the lord, and the land is known as a fief. In exchange for the use of the fief and the protection of the lord, the vassal provides service to the lord. There are many varieties of feudal land tenure, consisting of military and non-military service. The obligations and corresponding rights between lord and vassal concerning the fief form the basis of the feudal relationship."

 et_institutions.18.t:0 "Three-Field Crop Rotation"
 et_institutions.18.d:0 "Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons. Under the three-field system, the arable land of an estate or village is divided into three large fields: one is planted in the autumn with winter wheat or rye; the second field is planted with other crops such as peas, lentils, or beans; and the third is left fallow, in order to allow the soil of that field to regain its nutrients. With each rotation, the field is used differently, so that a field would be planted for two out of the three years used, whilst one year it 'rests'. Previously a two-field system had been in place, with half the land being left fallow. The three field system allows farmers to plant more crops and therefore to increase production and legumes have the ability to fix nitrogen and so fertilize the soil. With more crops available to sell, this also helps the economy in general to thrive."
