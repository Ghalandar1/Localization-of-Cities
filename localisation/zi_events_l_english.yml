 zi_1EVTNAME:0 "Undead Invasion"
 zi_1EVTDESC:0 "Lately, many of villages, towns and cities were struck by strange disease. Our medics and holy men couldn't understand how it could happen. Even worse, the dead started to walk and attack others! The hordes are growing stronger every day and we have to prepare our defenses!"
 zi_1EVTOPTION:0 "The end times are upon us!"
 zi_2EVTNAME:0 "Undead Invasion"
 zi_2EVTDESC:0 "The horde has arrived. With it, the special traits of it too. The strong unbreakable morale, lack of cavarly and ships but giant troop count. Although it has no way of obtaining manpower, it takes everybody in captured province."
 zi_2EVTOPTION:0 "The end of days"
 zi_6EVTNAME:0 "Zombie Invasion!"
 zi_6EVTDESC:0 "Another war shall start to expand our horde even more!"
 zi_6EVTOPTION:0 "To arms!"
 zi_7EVTNAME:0 "Decline of the Undeads"
 zi_7EVTDESC:0 "The last years were a series of great successes of the Zombie Horde, as it grew and fought off much of the world. But now, the great problem approaches - as most food from the undead captured provinces is gone, they're not able to function properly, and they're dying out of starvation. Since now, their horde will slowly lose provinces, until nothing is there."
 zi_7EVTOPTION:0 "The end of end days?"
 zi_8EVTNAME:0 "Another province is empty!"
 zi_8EVTDESC:0 "Yet another province has became free of any undeads, after the depleting resources of food. Now it's just a piece of empty land."
 zi_8EVTOPTION:0 "Damn it!"
 zi_9EVTNAME:0 "Invading force is here!"
 zi_9EVTDESC:0 "After the capture of $CAPITAL$ we could capture most of it's inhabitants by surprise! Now they're part of our great army that shall conquer most of the known world!"
 zi_9EVTOPTION:0 "Our time is now" 
 zi_10EVTNAME:0 "Unity"
 zi_10EVTDESC:0 "In the face of the Undead threat, we have no other choice but to fight against the zombie horde, or perish trying!"
 zi_10EVTOPTION:0 "We will defend our glorious land!" 
 zi_11EVTNAME:0 "Peace"
 zi_11EVTDESC:0 "Since the zombie hordes have came, it would be a wise choice to give up our senseless conflicts and face the stronger enemy together. Every war would be concluded with a white peace for now."
 zi_11EVTOPTIONA:0 "United we stand, divided we fall!"
 zi_11EVTOPTIONB:0 "Ha! Nobody will expect us not to make peace!"
 zi_14EVTNAME:0 "Our subjects"
 zi_14EVTDESC:0 "As the undead hordes are approaching, we see far higher level of unity between people, as it's clearly visible within our vassals - they all desire to beocme part of our country, as they see it as the safest choice in the modern, unsure world. But should we agree?"
 zi_14EVTOPTIONA:0 "We've to become one!"
 zi_14EVTOPTIONB:0 "It'd be better for them to become marches."
 zi_15EVTNAME:0 "A help to fight"
 zi_15EVTDESC:0 "The extraordinary level of unity between humans, and the organisation of our state as a march, gave us new strenght - we're able to conscript more people, collect more taxes and mobilise entire society to fight for the cause!"
 zi_15EVTOPTION:0 "Great!" 
 zi_16EVTNAME:0 "End of days"
 zi_16EVTDESC:0 "The Caliph living in Cairo has declared that this is the 'end of days'. According to him, the ancient Sunni prophecy once told, that 'There will be time, when the armies of Rome will be defeated by Mujahideen army at Dabiq in Syria. Then, they will march until Bosphorus, where the army of Antichrist will push them all the way back to Jerusalem - from there, with the help of Jesus, who will kill the Antichrist by a spear while descending from heaven, they shall conquer entire world'. Caliph potrays the undeads s the Romans, who 'always threatened the Muslim faith'. This motivates all muslims to repulse the undead hordes, and then, conquer rest of the world!"
 zi_16EVTOPTION:0 "Allah is great!"
 zi_17EVTNAME:0 "Refugees"
 zi_17EVTDESC:0 "Lately, a stream of refugees has been flowing into $PROVINCENAME$ from the endangered regions - they may prove to be a serious problem, as rivalry between them and locals about the food, shelter and water may prove unrest in this province."
 zi_17EVTOPTIONA:0 "Let them in"
 zi_17EVTOPTIONB:0 "Don't let them in"
 zi_18EVTNAME:0 "Volunteers"
 zi_18EVTDESC:0 "'Death to undeads! We never will give up our land!' - the chant is heard all over the realm, and there's no need to convince those people to take up arms against the zombie horde. In a matter of fact, a group of volunteers have gathered in one of provinces, armed and ready to fight the undeads."
 zi_18EVTOPTION:0 "Great!"
 zi_19EVTNAME:0 "Conspiracy theorists"
 zi_19EVTDESC:0 "The horde, although is a clear threat to entire known world, doesn't affect others that much. The voices of conspiracy theorists, that claim the undeads are just a game made up by governments, that want to terrify them to raise the taxes. We can ignore it of course, but it could have many negative consequences."
 zi_19EVTOPTIONA:0 "Show them the threat is real"
 zi_19EVTOPTIONB:0 "Let them complain"
 zi_20EVTNAME:0 "Unity"
 zi_20EVTDESC:0 "Our nation is united as never before, as people face together the common enemy. Thanks to that, most unrest is gone, as people have far bigger issues than taxes."
 zi_20EVTOPTION:0 "Great!"
 zi_21EVTNAME:0 "Found old crown"
 zi_21EVTDESC:0 "In one of our colonies, we've found a crown, that surely was manufactured before the Zombie Invasion - it's hard to tell where it is from, or how it got into this province, but surely, it's a sign from heavens, that our rule is given from the heavens."
 zi_21EVTOPTION:0 "Great!"
 zi_22EVTNAME:0 "The end of the horde"
 zi_22EVTDESC:0 "After all these years of constant war, the horde has been finally destroyed! Thousands, if not millions of people started celebrations, that will last long for sure. But although, this is the greatest day in history of humanity, there are still many challenges. For sure, the world won't rebuild itself, and the long hidden rivalry will erupt again, after the horde is gone."
 zi_22EVTOPTION:0 "Truly a great day"
 zi_22_tooltip:0 "All invasion-related modifiers and effects will be removed"
 zi_23EVTNAME:0 "Reclaiming long lost cities"
 zi_23EVTDESC:0 "The dust covers almost everything inside any building. The streets are silent, while nature starts to take them back. But now, after all this time we will reclaim all those cities, starting from this exact one!"
 zi_23EVTOPTION:0 "It's time to reclaim our land!"
 zi_24EVTNAME:0 "New Crusade"
 zi_24EVTDESC:0 "Despite the fact, that last 'Crusade' failed miserably at Varna, and that the last 'true' Crusade happened in 1271, Pope decided to call another one - but this time, against the Undead threat, igniting long-dead Crusading zeal. It is expected that thousands of young nobles will join the fight."
 zi_24EVTOPTION:0 "Glorious"
 zi_25EVTNAME:0 "Global Jihad focuses on zombie horde"
 zi_25EVTDESC:0 "After long struggle with Soviets, then Americans, and finally virtually everybody in the Middle East, the global Jihadi movement found an enemy, that threatens not only the Islam, but the entire world - will the Mujahideen stop the Zombie Horde?"
 zi_25EVTOPTION:0 "Allah is great!"
 zi_26EVTNAME:0 "Commonwealth"
 zi_26EVTDESC:0 "In face of the common enemy - the Teutonic Order, Poland and Lithuania entered into a personal unnion to fight together against the Teutons. Which succeeded, as the battle of Grunwald showed. However, now there's even bigger common threat, so personal unnion may not be enough. That's why we believe that it's time for the real unnion. Who knows? Maybe we shall repeat Grunwald once again?"
 zi_26EVTOPTION:0 "Unite or die!"
 zi_27EVTNAME:0 "Scandinavia"
 zi_27EVTDESC:0 "The Kalmar Unnion finally brought peace to the Scandinavian countries. However, over all these years it didn't transfer into a real union. Until to this day. While Norway could join Denmark without a problem in such troublesome times, Sweden had to call a riskdag - which, surprisingly - agreed on becomming one state with Denmark. Since now, we will rename ourselves to Scandinaia, and prepare to face off the Undead threat!"
 zi_27EVTOPTION:0 "Unite or die!"
 zi_28EVTNAME:0 "Bandits"
 zi_28EVTDESC:0 "Sadly, not everybody is united in fight against the Zombie horde. Especially the bandits, who lately raided undefended parts of our country, and caused great chaos and loses in the land. Surely, it will not help our fight."
 zi_28EVTOPTION:0 "Damn!"
 zi_29EVTNAME:0 "Great general"
 zi_29EVTDESC:0 "One of our leaders, thankfuly to his high military skill found a great way to fight zombies! He created a strategy based on using the speed of cavalry and ranged attack of infantry to counter the Undead hordes. He is truly a god of warfare!"
 zi_29EVTOPTION:0 "Great!"
 zi_30EVTNAME:0 "Bad general"
 zi_30EVTDESC:0 "Unfortunatly, one of our leaders did not prove to be really succesful in the battlefield. In a matter of fact, his lack of good leadership traits made our army lose hope in victory - we really hope it won't doom us all!"
 zi_30EVTOPTION:0 "Damn!"
 zi_31EVTNAME:0 "The last stand"
 zi_31EVTDESC:0 "Our capital is the last fort in our country. This news struck thousands of citizens of our realm, and since they do not want to lose their last home, thousands decided to join local garrison. With them, we will never fall!"
 zi_31EVTOPTION:0 "To the last drop of blood!"
 zi_32EVTNAME:0 "Heir falls ill"
 zi_32EVTDESC:0 "The heir has been lying in bed for the last few days, and his disease is looking strangely similar to the undead one. Rumors aroused that he is in fact becomming an undead! While chance it's true is relatively low, medics admit, that's indeed possible. Will you let him live and risk the disease overtake your capital, or kill him to be safe?"
 zi_32EVTOPTIONA:0 "Kill him!"
 zi_32EVTOPTIONB:0 "Let him live!"
 zi_33EVTNAME:0 "Trading with diseases"
 zi_33EVTDESC:0 "Since the beginning of the zombie invasion, trade is a very dangerous thing. Recently, there were even reports, that undeads have infiltrated some merchant ships! Shall we beliebe them and close our ports, or we shouldn't pay attention to these rumors?"
 zi_33EVTOPTIONA:0 "Close the ports!"
 zi_33EVTOPTIONB:0 "Better not..."
 zi_34EVTNAME:0 "Crops ruined!"
 zi_34EVTDESC:0 "Zombies ravaging through our countryside ruined many of the fields, causing hunger around the realm. This, along with the hard war makes the population even angrier. But with any luck, it won't cause much trouble."
 zi_34EVTOPTION:0 "Damn!"
 zi_35EVTNAME:0 "Jews targetted"
 zi_35EVTDESC:0 "There's no such thing as a problem without blame. And as usually, people decided to blame the Jews. Angry mobs are attacking Jewish houses in the cities and ruining workshops in the entire realm. Should we protect them, since it's probably not their fault, or join the angry mobs?"
 zi_35EVTOPTIONA:0 "Step in and protect them"
 zi_35EVTOPTIONB:0 "Death to Jews!"
 zi_36EVTNAME:0 "Last charge of the Pope"
 zi_36EVTDESC:0 "The Rome was just about to fall, the supplies almost ran out, and there was no hope for immediate rescue from outside. Because of this, Pope and his bodyguards decided for a heroic move - gather the last horses from the city and charge against the undead hordes, in an attempt to break out and reach the sea. It is unclear if they succeeded or not, yet still it is seen as a giant act of bravery, and show that the Christian faith is not yet dead!"
 zi_36EVTOPTION:0 "Respect to the Pope!"
 zi_37EVTNAME:0 "Support from members of EU"
 zi_37EVTDESC:0 "The members of EU decided to support us in our struggle against the zombie hordes, with everything they could spare for us. It's a great help that will surely make us ready to face the undead hordes!"
 zi_37EVTOPTION:0 "Glorious!"
 zi_38EVTNAME:0 "Death of the Caliph"
 zi_38EVTDESC:0 "The news has already spread out of Cairo, as the Muslims all around the world are already mourning this fact. The Caliph is dead. Despite he was just a puppet for the last few centuries, he was still a direct descendand from the Muhammad. But can the undead hordes break the spirit of Muslims? Time will show..."
 zi_38EVTOPTION:0 "A grim day"
 zi_39EVTNAME:0 "Burning of books"
 zi_39EVTDESC:0 "First the Jews, now the books.. Thousands of people are burning them at stakes for their heritical content. Although it's not stopping the undeads, it surely distracts our citizens from revolting against our rule."
 zi_39EVTOPTION:0 "Ok I guess"
 zi_40EVTNAME:0 "Catching the occasion"
 zi_40EVTDESC:0 "England is surely busy with fighting against the undead hordes on the continent. With the horde, that cannot reach us. This seems like a perfect occasion to attack England and take as much land from them as it is possible, before it's too late! Should we take action?"
 zi_40EVTOPTIONA:0 "We're still not ready for it..."
 zi_40EVTOPTIONB:0 "Push the border!"
 zi_41EVTNAME:0 "Spill Blood On Fire"
 zi_41EVTDESC:0 "\"Let's talk about fight!\n Let's talk about misery!\n Let's take about hate!\"\n The wave of people singing those lirycs is going around the country, as they claim that they know how to heal the zombie disease! They believe all you have to do is spill the infected blood on fire. They want to care about the past by caring about the tommorow, but as we believed it for a while, the disaster is not far behind. We found out that this solution is rather pointless, but it gave hope to people to find the inner peace and repent to still carry on."
 zi_41EVTOPTION:0 "Heavenly!"
 zi_42EVTNAME:0 "Undead bandits?"
 zi_42EVTDESC:0 "Bandits in our realm found a new way to raid and steal what they can - lately, painted like undeads and screaming in a horrific way, they made inhabitants of one village flee and leave all goods behind! Everything of value was looted within minutes. This tactic not only causes great loses in the material goods, but also plants fear in hearts of normal people. This cannot end well..."
 zi_42EVTOPTION:0 "Damn!"
 zi_43EVTNAME:0 "Army of destroyed country"
 zi_43EVTDESC:0 "After one of the nations has fallen, the remnants of it's army came to us, asking to join the fight alongside our units against the zombie horde. However, despite them saving some of their old equipment, we would have to spend some money on equipping them properly."
 zi_43EVTOPTIONA:0 "We don't need them"
 zi_43EVTOPTIONB:0 "Hire them"
 zi_44EVTNAME:0 "Wizna recovered"
 zi_44EVTDESC:0 "Recently, we estabilished a colony in Wizna. One of the first thing to find, was a site of a battle, between brave Polish soldiers and the undead hordes. From what we saw, it looks like Poles faced the zombies for 3 days, repelling all the assaults on their defense positions. Despite the fact they were left alone by their treacherous Western allies, and the were outnubered 1:4000 they held brave, and had not surrendered. This is a truly great monument of bravery, and we're blessed to recover it."
 zi_44EVTOPTION:0 "Hurr durr Wizna"
 zi_45EVTNAME:0 "Long lost knowledge"
 zi_45EVTDESC:0 "In $PROVINCENAME$ we have found the old books from before the Zombie invasion. They all had knowledge, that we all thought was long lost, and it will help us in our technological advancements."
 zi_45EVTOPTION:0 "Great!"
 zi_46EVTNAME:0 "Treasure found in $PROVINCENAME$"
 zi_46EVTDESC:0 "After colonising the $PROVINCENAME$, we found there a larger treasure. It is unclear how it got there, but neverthless, it's a good boost for our economy."
 zi_46EVTOPTION:0 "Great!"
 zi_47EVTNAME:0 "Lack of good leadership"
 zi_47EVTDESC:0 "We lack any good general to lead our forces, because of that the soldiers feel lost and unsure about the future, as they're led by lesser men, which has devastating effects on their morale. Let's just hope it won't doom us..."
 zi_47EVTOPTION:0 "Damn!"
 zi_48EVTNAME:0 "Leave the continent"
 zi_48EVTDESC:0 "As the Europe is overran with undeads, and as Dalmatia is no longer uiner our jurisdiction, it might be wise just to leave Europe behind and seal off on Venice and our other islands. However, shall we abandon our brothers in Italy?"
 zi_48EVTOPTIONB:0 "We don't have any brothers"
 zi_48EVTOPTIONA:0 "We will not leave them alone!"
 zi_49EVTNAME:0 "Steppe and horses"
 zi_49EVTDESC:0 "Vast steppes, devoid of water and food, combined with fast horses and reflective bows are probably one of the most effective weapons against the slow undead hordes. That's why we, the steppe hordes will not be a easy prey for them, of course if they even manage to catch us!"
 zi_49EVTOPTION:0 "Too fast for them!"
 zi_50EVTNAME:0 "Rumors of zombies behind the lines"
 zi_50EVTDESC:0 "The rumors are not helping us once again, as they spread fear of the cities previously uneffected by zombie hordes, now are being besieged by them! Of course, it's a false, but the rumors spread very fast and make everybody feel insecure and unsure about the future. This will have very bad effect on our economy."
 zi_50EVTOPTION:0 "Damn!"
 zi_51EVTNAME:0 "Sealing off"
 zi_51EVTDESC:0 "Our nation, surrounded by water, the wall the zombies cannot cross is perfectly safe right now. However, we can still aid other nations by sending them troops and put effort in destroying undead hordes. We must decide, if our safety is more important, or the common cause."
 zi_51EVTOPTIONA:0 "Seal off!"
 zi_51EVTOPTIONB:0 "We will not betray the rest!"
 zi_52EVTNAME:0 "Disbelievers shocked!"
 zi_52EVTDESC:0 "Recently, in $PROVINCENAME$, local disbelievers were shocked, as undead hordes flown into their homeland. Many of them fled, and spreaded all across the country, teling the news of their doomed, unprepared homeland. Now, the rest of them, that used not to believe in the Undead invasion, saw the truth, and abandoned the false belief, and now they're better prepared for the invasion of their homes."
 zi_52EVTOPTION:0 "Great!"
 zi_53EVTNAME:0 "Sealing off"
 zi_53EVTDESC:0 "What French couldn't accomplish, was done by the zombies. And since we don't have any possesions on the continent anymore, it would be a wise move to leave them to the undeads, and focus on islands around us, and then, one day, maybe reclaiming the lost land there. What will be our decision?"
 zi_53EVTOPTIONB:0 "We will not give up on continent!"
 zi_53EVTOPTIONA:0 "Great Britain is an island, not part of Europe"
 zi_54EVTNAME:0 "Revive of Wagenburg"
 zi_54EVTDESC:0 "Wagenburg, the old Hussite tactic of iputting wagons in rectangles of circles, was abandoned in 1434, after the battle of Lipany. However, we could update it, using the armored vehicles and tanks, which is a great way to counter the steady masses of zombies. With that, we will surely fight them better!"
 zi_54EVTOPTION:0 "Great!"
 zi_55EVTNAME:0 "Loss of a province"
 zi_55EVTDESC:0 "The $PROVINCENAME$ was occupied by our enemies, and we lost effective control over it! As there's nobody left there anymore, the province became entirely empty."
 zi_55EVTOPTION:0 "Damn!"
 zi_56EVTNAME:0 "Welcome to Zombie Invasion!"
 zi_56EVTDESC:0 "Welcome, and thank you very much for playing Zombie Invasion. As you may have read earlier, it's a mod that brings the popular idea of zombie invasion into EU IV. If you have any suggestions, issues or any problems, then you can check the workshop page or forum to get the answers for your problems. So now, good luck and have fun.\n \n Feel free to donate me at my patreon (link avaible in mod description), as any help is appreciated."
 zi_56EVTOPTION:0 "Ok"
 zi_57EVTNAME:0 "Trade goods"
 zi_57EVTDESC:0 "After estabilishing colony in $PROVINCENAME$ we managed to restore it's lost trade goods. Now, we can make a lot of income out of it."
 zi_57EVTOPTION:0 "Ok"
 zi_58EVTNAME:0 "Leaving Asia"
 zi_58EVTDESC:0 "Japan has been separated from the rest of the continent for hundreds of years. And how the kamikaze saved us from the Mongols, in the same way the sea is saving us from the horde. However, shall we abandon our Asian brothers?"
 zi_58EVTOPTIONA:0 "What brothers?"
 zi_58EVTOPTIONB:0 "Help the others!"
 zi_59EVTNAME:0 "Difficulty"
 zi_59EVTDESC:0 "Now, you will be given three configuarion events, that will affect the game - first, after many complained that Zombies are too weak, you can pick three difficulties - normal, hard and Doom of Makind one. Each one will make the zombie horde stronger, so pick wisely."
 zi_59EVTOPTIONA:0 "Normal"
 zi_59EVTOPTIONB:0 "Hard"
 zi_59EVTOPTIONC:0 "Doom of Mankind"
 zi_60EVTNAME:0 "Unit cap"
 zi_60EVTDESC:0 "As tests have shown, the EU IV is not really good at handling many units, that's why the unit cap of 500 units was put in place for zombies. However, since some people have stronger computers than the others, I made 3 other choices for cap. Remember, that this number will greatly affect perfomance."
 zi_60EVTOPTIONA:0 "500 (default)"
 zi_60EVTOPTIONB:0 "1000"
 zi_60EVTOPTIONC:0 "2000"
 zi_60EVTOPTIOND:0 "No cap (not recommended)"
 zi_61EVTNAME:0 "Notifications"
 zi_61EVTDESC:0 "The final event - notifications about capturing provinces and new armies, since many complained that it makes game more tiring and slower."
 zi_61EVTOPTIONA:0 "Turn off notifications"
 zi_61EVTOPTIONB:0 "Turn on"
 zi_62EVTNAME:0 "Province defect"
 zi_62EVTDESC:0 "One of our provinces was captured by the undead horde! We must throw all undeads out of it!"
 zi_62EVTOPTION:0 "Damn!"
 zi_63EVTNAME:0 "Extra colonist"
 zi_63EVTDESC:0 "Coz why the hell not"
 zi_63EVTOPTION:0 "Let's repopulate the world!"
 zi_64EVTNAME:0 "End of the horde"
 zi_64EVTDESC:0 "The silence reigns, where in the past zombies reigned. The sound of growling of undeads is long gone, and nobody is left to hear it. After all these year, it's finally over"
 zi_64EVTOPTION:0 "The end of The End"
 zi_67EVTNAME:0 "Everything is fine"
 zi_67EVTDESC:0 "In latest speech to the nation, Kim Jong Un, the glorious leader of Democratic People's Republic of Korea, stated that all of these \"zombies\" are nothing more than just merely a western provocation, that is aiming to destabilize the nation, and it will not go unpunished"
 zi_67EVTOPTION:0 "North Korea, best Korea"
 zi_68EVTNAME:0 "Madagascar seals borders"
 zi_68EVTDESC:0 "Apparently some people around the world started to turn into zombies. Thankfuly, we played this awesome Pandemic game, so we exactly know what to do!"
 zi_68EVTOPTIONA:0 "SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING"
 zi_68EVTOPTIONB:0 "Are you implying I would play video games?"
 zi_69EVTNAME:0 "Panic"
 zi_69EVTDESC:0 "Sir, our population has fallen into total panic - they're running away like children! It will take a lot of resources to organise them once again..."
 zi_69EVTOPTION:0 "Darn it"
 zi_70EVTNAME:0 "CONOP 8888"
 zi_70EVTDESC:0 "CONOP 8888, the unclassified American document prepared in 2011 was some sort of excercise rather than a serious plan, but now it's become really helpful when the undead threat is really here. With this, our troops will fight better."
 zi_70EVTOPTION:0 "Great!"
 zi_71EVTNAME:0 "Disinformation"
 zi_71EVTDESC:0 "The internet is a great source of knowledge... And also disinformation. Recently many have turned to this \"source\" of information, learning many false facts about the horde, which led to unrest and fear."
 zi_71EVTOPTION:0 "\"Not everything on internet is true\" - Chewbacca"
 zi_72EVTNAME:0 "Propaganda"
 zi_72EVTDESC:0 "War propaganda has always been important part of warfare. Thanks to our one, the dissent was greatly reduced in our nation."
 zi_72EVTOPTION:0 "For out nation"
 zi_73EVTNAME:0 "UN troops sent to help"
 zi_73EVTDESC:0 "Our nation has received help from the United Nations in form of UN troops, they surely will assist in our heroic resistance against zombie horde."
 zi_73EVTOPTION:0 "Urra!"
 zi_74EVTNAME:0 "UN and EU condemns actions of Zombie Horde"
 zi_74EVTDESC:0 "After the aggressive actions of the Zombie Horde, the USA has called to gather the United Nations Security Council. In a special meeting, without any veto, they issued official CONDEMNATION of Horde's actions, and called to stop it's hostilities. Meanwhile, European Unnion informed Undeads, that \"Unless they stop their aggression of peaceful nations, they will face economic sanctions\". "
 zi_74EVTOPTION:0 "Another glorious victory of diplomacy."
 zi_75EVTNAME:0 "The ill-fated battle of $PROVINCENAME$"
 zi_75EVTDESC:0 "Some of our citizens have gathered to organise their own volunter army, that would attack the zombies. However, not everything went as planned, when one of the detachments of the army received an order to attack the enemy in front of them, which... Turned out to be the second detachment of their own army. Before they could realise their mistake, it was too late, and now everybody is mourning the loss against ourselves"
 zi_75EVTOPTION:0 "Damn it!"
